This is the code for the tutorial at http://evanhahn.com/?p=181
The source code for the javascript that we are testing is in assets/js/hello.js
The tests are all in assets/js/spec/helloTest.js
It pretty much follows the tutorial exactly. If you want to start the tutorial from scratch just empty out the contents of hello.js and helloTest.js
Thanks to Evan for posting the original tutorial
